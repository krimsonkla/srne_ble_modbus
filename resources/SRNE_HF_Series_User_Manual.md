#### 2.2 WIRING SPECIFICATIONS AND CIRCUIT BREAKER SELECTION......................................................................

Wiring and installation must comply with national and local electrical codes.
Recommended PV array wiring specifications and circuit breaker selection: Since the output current of
the PV array is affected by the type, connection method and illumination angle of the PV module, the
minimum wire diameter of the PV array is calculated according to its short-circuit current; refer to the
short-circuit current value in the PV module specification (the short-circuit current is constant when
the PV modules are connected in series; the short-circuit current is the sum of the short-circuit currents
of all PV modules connected in parallel); the short-circuit current of the PV array shall not exceed the
maximum input current.

Note: The wiring diameter is for reference only. If the distance between the PV array and the all-in-one
solar charge inverter or the distance between the all-in-one solar charge inverter and the battery is
relatively long, using a thicker wire can reduce the voltage drop to improve system performance.
Note: The above are only recommended wiring diameter and circuit breaker. Please select the
appropriate wiring diameter and circuit breaker according to actual situations.


#### 2.3 INSTALLATION AND WIRING

Installation steps:：

Step 1: Determine the installation position and the space for heat dissipation. Determine the

installation position of the all-in-one solar charge inverter, such as wall surface; when installing the all-
in-one solar charge inverter, ensure that there is enough air flowing through the heat sink, and space

of at least 200m to the left and right air outlets of the inverter shall be left to ensure natural convection

heat dissipation. Refer to the installation diagram of the whole machine as above.

```
Warning: Danger of explosion! Never install the all-in-one solar charge inverter and lead-acid
```
battery in the same confined space! Also do not install in a confined place where battery gas may

collect.


Step 2: Remove the terminal cover

Step3: Wiring

AC input / output wiring method:

```
① Prior to AC input/output wiring, disconnect the external circuit breaker and confirm that the
wire used is thick enough. Please refer to Section 2.2 “Wiring Specifications and Circuit Breaker
Selection”;
② Properly connect the AC input wire according to the wire sequence and terminal position
shown in the figure below. Please connect the ground wire first, and then the live wire and the
neutral wire;
```

#### ：Ground L：Live N：Neutral

```
③ Properly connect the AC output wire according to the wire sequence and terminal
position shown in the figure below. Please connect the ground wire first, and then the live
wire and the neutral wire. The ground wire is connected to the grounding screw hole on
the cabinet through the O-type terminal.
```
#### ：Ground L：Live N：Neutral

Note: The grounding wire shall be as thick as possible (cross-sectional area is not less than

4mm2). The grounding point shall be as close as possible to the all-in-one solar charge inverter.

The shorter the grounding wire, the better.


PV input wiring method:

```
① Prior to wiring, disconnect the external circuit breaker and confirm that the wire used
is thick enough. Please refer to Section 2.2 “Wiring Specifications and Circuit Breaker
Selection”;
② Properly connect the PV input wire according to the wire sequence and terminal
position shown in the figure below.
```
```
PV+: PV input positive pole PV-: PV input negative pole
```
BAT wiring method:

```
① Prior to wiring, disconnect the external circuit breaker and confirm that the wire used
is thick enough. Please refer to Section 2.2 “Wiring Specifications and Circuit Breaker
Selection”. The BAT wire needs to be connected to the machine through the O-type
terminal. The O-type terminal with an inner diameter of 5 mm is recommended. The O-
type terminal shall firmly press the BAT wire to prevent excessive heat generation caused
by excessive contact resistance;
② Properly connect the BAT wire according to the wire sequence and terminal position
shown in the figure below.
```

```
BAT+: Battery positive electrode BAT-: Battery negative electrode
```
Warnings:

① Mains input, AC output and PV array will generate high voltage. So, before wiring, be sure to

disconnect the circuit breaker or fuse;

② Be very careful during wiring; do not close the circuit breaker or fuse during wiring, and ensure that

the “+” and “-” pole leads of each component are connected properly; a circuit breaker must be

installed at the battery terminal. Refer to Section 2.2 “Wiring Specifications and Circuit Breaker

Selection” to select a right circuit breaker. Before wiring, be sure to disconnect the circuit breaker to

prevent strong electric sparks and avoid battery short circuit; if the all-in-one solar charge inverter is

used in an area with frequent lightning, it is recommended to install an external lightening arrester at

the PV input terminal.

Step 4: Check if the wiring is correct and firm. In particular, check if the battery polarity is reversed, if

the PV input polarity is reversed and if the AC input is properly connected.


Step 5: Install the terminals cover.

Step 6: Turn on the all-in-one solar charge inverter
First, close the circuit breaker at the battery terminal, and then turn the rocker switch
on the left side of the machine to the "ON" state. The "AC/INV" indicator flashing
indicates that the inverter is working normally. Close the circuit breakers of the PV
array and the Mains. Finally, turn on AC loads one by one as the AC output is normal
to avoid a protection action caused by a large momentary shock due to simultaneous
turning on the loads simultaneously. Now, the machine goes into a normal
operation according to the set mode.

Note: If power is supplied to different AC loads, it is recommended to first turn on the load with a
large surge current. After the load is stable, turn on the load with a small surge current.

Note: If the all-in-one solar charge inverter does not work properly or the LCD or indicator is abnormal,
refer to Chapter 6 to handle the exceptions.


### 3. OPERATING MODES

#### 3.1 CHARGING MODE

```
1) PV priority: PV module will charge the battery preferentially, and the battery is charged by the
Mains only when the PV system fails. During the day, solar energy is fully used to charge, while at
night, it converts to the Mains. This can maintain battery level, and is ideal for areas where the
grid is relatively stable and electricity price is relatively high.
```
```
2) Mains priority: The Mains supply is preferentially used to charge the battery. Only when the Mains
fails, the PV charging can be activated.
```
```
3) Hybrid charging: PV and mains hybrid charging. PV MPPT charging is a priority, and when PV
energy is insufficient, the mains supply supplements. When the PV energy is sufficient again, the
mains stops charging. This is the fastest charging mode, suitable for the areas where power grid
is unstable, providing sufficient backup power supply at any time.
```
```
4) Only Solar (Only Solar): Only PV charging, without Mains charging. This is the most energy-
efficient way in which battery is charged only by solar panels, and is usually used in areas with
good lighting conditions.
```

#### 3.2 OUTPUT MODE

 PV priority mode: Loads are powered by the PV module and battery. Diversified charging mode

```
and output mode are optional. When PV priority mode is selected, utilization of green solar
energy can be maximized to achieve energy saving and emission reduction.
Switch to mains supply when the PV charging fails. This mode maximizes the use of solar energy
while maintaining battery power, suitable for use in the areas with relatively stable grid.
```
 Mains priority mode: Switch to inverter only when the mains fails. Then, the unit is equivalent

```
to a backup UPS, suitable for areas with unstable grid.
```
##  Inverter priority mode: Switch to mains supply only when the battery is under voltage. This

## mode maximizes the use of DC power and is used in the area with stable grid.

### 5. OTHER FUNCTIONS

#### 5.1 DRY NODE

Working principle: This dry node can control the ON/OFF of the diesel generator to

charge the battery. ① Normally, the terminals are that the NC-N point is closed and

the NO-N point is open; ② When the battery voltage reaches the low voltage

disconnection point, the relay coil is energized, and the terminals turn to that the

NO-N point is closed while NC-N point is open. At this point, NO-N point can drive

resistive loads: 125VAC/1A, 230VAC/1A, 30VDC/1A.

#### 5.2 RS485/CAN COMMUNICATION PORT

This port is an RS485/CAN communication port ; CAN communication is an optional function, which

is not available in the standard machine.

This port is an RS485 communication port which comes with two functions:
① It allows direct communication with the optional host computer (stored on the
CD-ROM) developed by our company through this port, and enables monitoring of
the equipment running status and setting of some parameters on the computer;
② It also allows direct connection with the optional RS485 to Bluetooth
communication module developed by our company through this port. After the
module is selected, you can connect the all-in-one solar charge inverter through
the mobile phone Bluetooth APP, on which you can view the operating parameters
and status of the device.

As shown in the figure:
Pin 1 is 5V power supply, Pin 2 is GND, Pin 7 is RS485-A, and Pin 8 is RS485-B ;
Pin 5 is CAN-H, and Pin 6 is CAN-L ;

#### 5.3 USB COMMUNICATION PORT

This is a USB communication port, which can be used for USB communication with

the optional PC host software in the CD-ROM. To use this port, you should install

the corresponding "USB to serial chip CH340T driver" in the computer.

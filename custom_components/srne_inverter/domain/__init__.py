"""Domain layer for SRNE Inverter integration.

This layer contains:
- Interfaces: Protocol definitions for ports and adapters
- Value Objects: Immutable domain primitives
- Entities: Domain objects with identity and business logic
- Domain Services: Pure business logic without infrastructure dependencies

The domain layer has ZERO dependencies on external libraries (except Python stdlib).
All external dependencies are abstracted behind interfaces.

"""Presentation layer for Home Assistant integration.

The presentation layer is the outermost layer that:
- Interacts with Home Assistant framework
- Handles UI and user interactions (config flow)
- Manages entities and platforms
- Orchestrates application layer use cases

This layer depends on application and domain layers but NOT vice versa.
